As President of his local branch, Stott began to raise his profile around the electorate and in farming circles, helping to found the Farmers Protection Association in 1929, the South Australian Wheatgrowers Protection Association (SAWPA) in 1930 and the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation (AWF) in 1931. He was also appointed General Secretary of each of these organisations.  Stott was considering seeking Country Party preselection for his local Electoral district of Albert at the 1933 election when it was announced that the Country Party would merge with the urban based Liberal Federation to form the Liberal and Country League (LCL). He opposed the move, fearing both that the rural prerogative of the Country Party would be diminished and that his preselection may become more difficult. His fears were partly realised when he lost LCL pre-selection; Stott promptly resigned from the party to run as an independent.  Stott was given little chance of winning. However, his standing within the influential wheat farming community in Albert, his Masonic connections, and his vocal opposition to the Country Party/Liberal Federation merger led to his election. He soon proved to be a thorn in the side of the newly elected LCL government of Richard Layton Butler, being dubbed the \"Farmer's Champion\" due to his vocal support of Great Depression affected farmers. Given that the state's ALP remained ineffective and torn by internecine feuding after Lionel Hill's unpopular premiership, Stott was considered by the LCL to be \"a greater nuisance than the whole of the Opposition put together\".","apiMetacritic":83,"id":"SmCPuSVlYICHYPBAqYxH","apiGenres":["Action","Simulation","Arcade","Massively Multiplayer","Indie"],"apiGameName":"Minecraft","date":"11.11.11","apiBackgroundImage":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b4e/b4e4c73d5aa4ec66bbf75375c4847a2b.jpg","score":"s1","apiGameReleased":"2009-05-10"},{"date":"22.11.11","apiGameName":"Dota 2","apiGenres":["Action","Massively Multiplayer"],"id":"lTxhu1nJbVMSgCnAhZyQ","apiGameReleased":"2013-07-09","apiBackgroundImage":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/83f/83f6f70a7c1b86cd2637b029d8b42caa.jpg","description":"sjghsjkgsfg","score":"s10","apiMetacritic":90}]
